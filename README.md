# CAUTION: This work is still in progress

In order to learn more about graphQL and typescript. I decided to create a DnD website, using the [dnd5eAPI](http://www.dnd5eapi.co/docs/#overview), please note that this project is still in progress and the code is not yet fully finished. Feel free to take a look and five me some feedbacks so I can learn! :muscle:
